= Healthchecks

Healthchecks are periodical tests which verify the health of an application.
When a Healthcheck probe fails, Kubernetes assumes that the application is not healthy and attempts to fix it.

Kubernetes supports two types of Healthcheck probes:

* Liveness probes
* Readiness probes

For more details about the probes, see {K8sLivenessReadinessProbes}.
Both types of probes are used in {ProductName} components.

Users can configure selected options for liveness and readiness probes.
