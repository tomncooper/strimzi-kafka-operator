= Supported clients for the {ProductName} Kafka Bridge

You can use the Kafka Bridge to integrate both _internal_ and _external_ HTTP client applications with your Kafka cluster.

* Internal clients are container-based HTTP clients running in _the same_ Kubernetes cluster as the Kafka Bridge itself.

* External clients are HTTP clients running _outside_ the Kubernetes cluster in which the Kafka Bridge is deployed and running.

Internal clients can access the Kafka Bridge on the host and port defined in the `KafkaBridge` custom resource. External clients can access the Kafka Bridge through an OpenShift Route, a LoadBalancer Service, or a Kubernetes Ingress.
