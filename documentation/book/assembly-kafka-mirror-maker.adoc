= Kafka Mirror Maker

The Cluster Operator deploys one or more Kafka Mirror Maker replicas to replicate data between Kafka clusters.
This process is called mirroring to avoid confusion with the Kafka partitions replication concept.
The Mirror Maker consumes messages from the source cluster and republishes those messages to the target cluster.

For information about example resources and the format for deploying Kafka Mirror Maker, see xref:assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-mirror-maker-str[Kafka Mirror Maker configuration].
