= TLS connections

== Zookeeper communication

Zookeeper does not support TLS itself. 
By deploying a TLS sidecar within every Zookeeper pod, the Cluster Operator is able to provide data encryption and authentication between Zookeeper nodes in a cluster.
Zookeeper only communicates with the TLS sidecar over the loopback interface.
The TLS sidecar then proxies all Zookeeper traffic, TLS decrypting data upon entry into a Zookeeper pod, and TLS encrypting data upon departure from a Zookeeper pod.

This TLS encrypting `stunnel` proxy is instantiated from the `spec.zookeeper.stunnelImage` specified in the Kafka resource.

== Kafka interbroker communication

Communication between Kafka brokers is done through the `REPLICATION` listener on port 9091, which is encrypted by default.

Communication between Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes uses a TLS sidecar, as described above.

== Topic and User Operators

Like the Cluster Operator, the Topic and User Operators each use a TLS sidecar when communicating with Zookeeper. The Topic Operator connects to Kafka brokers on port 9091.

== Kafka Client connections

Encrypted communication between Kafka brokers and clients running within the same Kubernetes cluster is provided through the `CLIENTTLS` listener on port 9093.

Encrypted communication between Kafka brokers and clients running outside the same Kubernetes cluster is provided through the `EXTERNAL` listener on port 9094.

NOTE: You can use the `CLIENT` listener on port 9092 for unencrypted communication with brokers.
