= Reconciliation

Although the operator reacts to all notifications about the desired cluster resources received from the Kubernetes cluster,
if the operator is not running, or if a notification is not received for any reason, the desired resources will get out of sync with the state of the running Kubernetes cluster.

In order to handle failovers properly, a periodic reconciliation process is executed by the Cluster Operator so that it can compare the state of the desired resources with the current cluster deployments in order to have a consistent state across all of them.
You can set the time interval for the periodic reconciliations using the xref:STRIMZI_FULL_RECONCILIATION_INTERVAL_MS[] variable.
