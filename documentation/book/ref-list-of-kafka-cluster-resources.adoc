= List of resources created as part of Kafka cluster

The following resources will created by the Cluster Operator in the Kubernetes cluster:

`_cluster-name_-kafka`:: StatefulSet which is in charge of managing the Kafka broker pods.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-brokers`:: Service needed to have DNS resolve the Kafka broker pods IP addresses directly.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-bootstrap`:: Service can be used as bootstrap servers for Kafka clients.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-external-bootstrap`:: Bootstrap service for clients connecting from outside of the Kubernetes cluster. This resource will be created only when external listener is enabled.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-_pod-id_`:: Service used to route traffic from outside of the Kubernetes cluster to individual pods. This resource will be created only when external listener is enabled.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-external-bootstrap`:: Bootstrap route for clients connecting from outside of the Kubernetes cluster. This resource will be created only when external listener is enabled and set to type `route`.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-_pod-id_`:: Route for traffic from outside of the Kubernetes cluster to individual pods. This resource will be created only when external listener is enabled and set to type `route`.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-config`:: ConfigMap which contains the Kafka ancillary configuration and is mounted as a volume by the Kafka broker pods.
`_cluster-name_-kafka-brokers`:: Secret with Kafka broker keys.
`_cluster-name_-kafka`:: Service account used by the Kafka brokers.
`_cluster-name_-kafka`:: Pod Disruption Budget configured for the Kafka brokers.
`strimzi-_namespace-name_-_cluster-name_-kafka-init`:: Cluster role binding used by the Kafka brokers.
`_cluster-name_-zookeeper`:: StatefulSet which is in charge of managing the Zookeeper node pods.
`_cluster-name_-zookeeper-nodes`:: Service needed to have DNS resolve the Zookeeper pods IP addresses directly.
`_cluster-name_-zookeeper-client`:: Service used by Kafka brokers to connect to Zookeeper nodes as clients.
`_cluster-name_-zookeeper-config`:: ConfigMap which contains the Zookeeper ancillary configuration and is mounted as a volume by the Zookeeper node pods.
`_cluster-name_-zookeeper-nodes`:: Secret with Zookeeper node keys.
`_cluster-name_-zookeeper`:: Pod Disruption Budget configured for the Zookeeper nodes.
`_cluster-name_-entity-operator`:: Deployment with Topic and User Operators. This resource will be created only if Cluster Operator deployed Entity Operator.
`_cluster-name_-entity-topic-operator-config`:: Configmap with ancillary configuration for Topic Operators. This resource will be created only if Cluster Operator deployed Entity Operator.
`_cluster-name_-entity-user-operator-config`:: Configmap with ancillary configuration for User Operators. This resource will be created only if Cluster Operator deployed Entity Operator.
`_cluster-name_-entity-operator-certs`:: Secret with Entitiy operators keys for communication with Kafka and Zookeeper. This resource will be created only if Cluster Operator deployed Entity Operator.
`_cluster-name_-entity-operator`:: Service account used by the Entity Operator.
`strimzi-_cluster-name_-topic-operator`:: Role binding used by the Entity Operator.
`strimzi-_cluster-name_-user-operator`:: Role binding used by the Entity Operator.
`_cluster-name_-cluster-ca`:: Secret with the Cluster CA used to encrypt the cluster communication.
`_cluster-name_-cluster-ca-cert`:: Secret with the Cluster CA public key. This key can be used to verify the identity of the Kafka brokers.
`_cluster-name_-clients-ca`::  Secret with the Clients CA used to encrypt the communication between Kafka brokers and Kafka clients.
`_cluster-name_-clients-ca-cert`:: Secret with the Clients CA public key. This key can be used to verify the identity of the Kafka brokers.
`_cluster-name_-cluster-operator-certs`:: Secret with Cluster operators keys for communication with Kafka and Zookeeper.
`data-_cluster-name_-kafka-_idx_`:: Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the Kafka broker pod `_idx_`. This resource will be created only if persistent storage is selected for provisioning persistent volumes to store data.
`data-_id_-_cluster-name_-kafka-_idx_`:: Persistent Volume Claim for the volume `_id_` used for storing data for the Kafka broker pod `_idx_`. This resource is only created if persistent storage is selected for JBOD volumes when provisioning persistent volumes to store data.
`data-_cluster-name_-zookeeper-_idx_`:: Persistent Volume Claim for the volume used for storing data for the Zookeeper node pod `_idx_`. This resource will be created only if persistent storage is selected for provisioning persistent volumes to store data.
