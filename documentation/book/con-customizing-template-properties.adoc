= Template properties

You can use the `template` property to configure aspects of the resource creation process.
You can include it in the following resources and properties:

* Kafka.spec.kafka
* Kafka.spec.zookeeper
* Kafka.spec.entityOperator
* KafkaConnect.spec
* KafkaConnectS2I.spec
* KafkaMirrorMakerSpec

In the following example, the `template` property is used to modify the labels in a Kafka broker's `StatefulSet`:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
  labels:
    app: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    template:
      statefulset:
        metadata:
          labels:
            mylabel: myvalue
    # ...
----

.Supported resources in Kafka cluster

`brokersService`:: Configures the headless service.
`externalBootstrapService`:: Configures the bootstrap service used by clients connecting to Kafka brokers from outside of Kubernetes.
`perPodService`:: Configures the per-Pod services used by clients connecting to the Kafka broker from outside Kubernetes to access individual brokers.
ifdef::OpenShift[]
`externalBootstrapRoute`:: Configures the bootstrap route used by clients connecting to the Kafka brokers from outside of OpenShift using OpenShift `Routes`.
`perPodRoute`:: Configures the per-Pod routes used by clients connecting to the Kafka broker from outside OpenShift to access individual brokers using OpenShift `Routes`.
