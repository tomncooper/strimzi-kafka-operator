= Configuring rack awareness in Kafka brokers

Kafka rack awareness can be configured in the `rack` property of `Kafka.spec.kafka`.
The `rack` object has one mandatory field named `topologyKey`.
This key needs to match one of the labels assigned to the {ProductPlatformName} cluster nodes.
The label is used by {ProductPlatformName} when scheduling the Kafka broker pods to nodes.
If the {ProductPlatformName} cluster is running on a cloud provider platform, that label should represent the availability zone where the node is running.
Usually, the nodes are labeled with `failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone` that can be easily used as the `topologyKey` value.
This has the effect of spreading the broker pods across zones, and also setting the brokers' `broker.rack` configuration parameter inside Kafka broker.

.Prerequisites

* {AProductPlatformName} cluster
* A running Cluster Operator

.Procedure

. Consult your {ProductPlatformName} administrator regarding the node label that represents the zone / rack into which the node is deployed.
. Edit the `rack` property in the `Kafka` resource using the label as the topology key.
