= Certificates and `Secrets`

{ProductName} stores CA, component and Kafka client private keys and certificates in `Secrets`.
All keys are 2048 bits in size.

CA certificate validity periods, expressed as a number of days after certificate generation, can be configured in `Kafka.spec.clusterCa.validityDays`
and `Kafka.spec.clusterCa.validityDays`.

|===

The CA certificates in `_<cluster>_-cluster-ca-cert` must be trusted by Kafka client applications so that they validate the Kafka broker certificates when connecting to Kafka brokers over TLS.

NOTE: Only `_<cluster>_-cluster-ca-cert` needs to be used by clients. 
All other `Secrets` in the table above only need to be accessed by the
 {ProductName} components.
 You can enforce this using Kubernetes role-based access controls if necessary.

== Client CA `Secrets`

[cols="3,2,5"]

|`Secret` name                     |Field within `Secret`     |Description

|`_<cluster>_-clients-ca`          |`ca.key`                  |The current private key for the clients CA.                                 
 
|`_<cluster>_-clients-ca-cert`     |`ca.crt`                  |The current certificate for the clients CA.
|===

The certificates in `_<cluster>_-clients-ca-cert` are those which the Kafka brokers trust.

NOTE: `_<cluster>_-cluster-ca` is used to sign certificates of client applications.
It needs to be accessible to the {ProductName} components and for administrative access if you are intending to issue application certificates without using the User Operator.
You can enforce this using Kubernetes role-based access controls if necessary.
