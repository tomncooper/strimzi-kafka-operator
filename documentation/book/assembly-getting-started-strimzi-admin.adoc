= Strimzi Administrators

{ProductName} includes several custom resources.
By default, permission to create, edit, and delete these resources is limited to Kubernetes cluster administrators.
If you want to allow non-cluster administators to manage {ProductName} resources, you must assign them the Strimzi Administrator role.
