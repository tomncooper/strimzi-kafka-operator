= Authentication support in Kafka Mirror Maker

Authentication can be configured in the `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.consumer.authentication` and `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.producer.authentication` properties.
The `authentication` property specifies the type of the authentication method which should be used and additional configuration details depending on the mechanism.
The currently supported authentication types are:

* TLS client authentication
* SASL-based authentication using the SCRAM-SHA-512 mechanism
* SASL-based authentication using the PLAIN mechanism

You can use different authentication mechanisms for the Kafka Mirror Maker producer and consumer.

== TLS Client Authentication

To use TLS client authentication, set the `type` property to the value `tls`.
TLS client authentication uses a TLS certificate to authenticate.
The certificate is specified in the `certificateAndKey` property and is always loaded from a Kubernetes secret.
In the secret, the certificate must be stored in X509 format under two different keys: public and private.

NOTE: TLS client authentication can be used only with TLS connections.
For more details about TLS configuration in Kafka Mirror Maker see xref:assembly-kafka-mirror-maker-tls-{context}[].

== SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

To configure Kafka Mirror Maker to use SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication, set the `type` property to `scram-sha-512`.
The broker listener to which clients will connect must also be configured to use SCRAM-SHA-512 SASL authentication.
This authentication mechanism requires a username and password.

* Specify the username in the `username` property.
* In the `passwordSecret` property, specify a link to a `Secret` containing the password. The `secretName` property contains the name of the `Secret` and the `password` property contains the name of the key under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.

IMPORTANT: Do not specify the actual password in the `password` field.

        password: my-producer-password-key

== PLAIN authentication

To configure Kafka Mirror Maker to use PLAIN authentication, set the `type` property to `plain`.
The broker listener to which clients will connect must also be configured to use SASL PLAIN authentication.
This authentication mechanism requires a username and password.

WARNING: The SASL PLAIN mechanism will transfer the username and password across the network in cleartext.
Only use SASL PLAIN authentication if TLS encryption is enabled.

* Specify the username in the `username` property.
* In the `passwordSecret` property, specify a link to a `Secret` containing the password.
The `secretName` property contains the name of the `Secret` and the `password` property contains the name of the key under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.

IMPORTANT: Do not specify the actual password in the `password` field.
