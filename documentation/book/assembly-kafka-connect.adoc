link:https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect[Kafka Connect^] is a tool for streaming data between Apache Kafka and external systems. It provides a framework for moving large amounts of data into and out of your Kafka cluster while maintaining scalability and reliability. Kafka Connect is typically used to integrate Kafka with external databases and storage and messaging systems.

You can use Kafka Connect to:

* Build connector plug-ins (as JAR files) for your Kafka cluster
* Run connectors

Kafka Connect includes the following built-in connectors for moving file-based data into and out of your Kafka cluster.

In {ProductName}, you can use the Cluster Operator to deploy a Kafka Connect
ifdef::OpenShift[ or Kafka Connect Source-2-Image (S2I) cluster ]
to your Kubernetes cluster.

A Kafka Connect cluster is implemented as a `Deployment` with a configurable number of workers. The Kafka Connect REST API is available on port 8083, as the `<connect-cluster-name>-connect-api` service.

ifdef::OpenShift[]
