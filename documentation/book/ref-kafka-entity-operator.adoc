= Configuration

The Entity Operator can be configured using the `entityOperator` property in `Kafka.spec`

The `entityOperator` property supports several sub-properties:

* `tlsSidecar`
* `topicOperator`
* `userOperator`
* `template`

The `tlsSidecar` property can be used to configure the TLS sidecar container which is used to communicate with Zookeeper.
For more details about configuring the TLS sidecar, see xref:assembly-tls-sidecar-{context}[].

The `template` property can be used to configure details of the Entity Operator pod, such as labels, annotations, affinity, tolerations and so on.

The `topicOperator` property contains the configuration of the Topic Operator.
When this option is missing, the Entity Operator is deployed without the Topic Operator.

The `userOperator` property contains the configuration of the User Operator.
When this option is missing, the Entity Operator is deployed without the User Operator.

When both `topicOperator` and `userOperator` properties are missing, the Entity Operator will be not deployed.

[id='topic-operator-{context}']
== Topic Operator

Topic Operator deployment can be configured using additional options inside the `topicOperator` object.
The following options are supported:

`watchedNamespace`::
The Kubernetes namespace in which the topic operator watches for `KafkaTopics`.
Default is the namespace where the Kafka cluster is deployed.

`reconciliationIntervalSeconds`::
The interval between periodic reconciliations in seconds.
Default `90`.

`zookeeperSessionTimeoutSeconds`::
The Zookeeper session timeout in seconds.
Default `20`.

`topicMetadataMaxAttempts`::
The number of attempts at getting topic metadata from Kafka.
The time between each attempt is defined as an exponential back-off.
Consider increasing this value when topic creation could take more time due to the number of partitions or replicas.
Default `6`.

`image`::
The `image` property can be used to configure the container image which will be used.
For more details about configuring custom container images, see xref:assembly-configuring-container-images-{context}[].

`resources`::
The `resources` property configures the amount of resources allocated to the Topic Operator.
For more details about resource request and limit configuration, see xref:assembly-resource-limits-and-requests-{context}[].

`logging`::
The `logging` property configures the logging of the Topic Operator.
+
The Topic Operator has its own configurable logger:
+
* `rootLogger.level`

== User Operator

User Operator deployment can be configured using additional options inside the `userOperator` object.
The following options are supported:

`watchedNamespace`::
The Kubernetes namespace in which the topic operator watches for `KafkaUsers`.
Default is the namespace where the Kafka cluster is deployed.

`reconciliationIntervalSeconds`::
The interval between periodic reconciliations in seconds.
Default `120`.

`zookeeperSessionTimeoutSeconds`::
The Zookeeper session timeout in seconds.
Default `6`.

`image`::
The `image` property can be used to configure the container image which will be used.
For more details about configuring custom container images, see xref:assembly-configuring-container-images-{context}[].

`resources`::
The `resources` property configures the amount of resources allocated to the User Operator.
For more details about resource request and limit configuration, see xref:assembly-resource-limits-and-requests-{context}[].

`logging`::
The `logging` property configures the logging of the User Operator.

The User Operator has its own configurable logger:

* `rootLogger.level`
