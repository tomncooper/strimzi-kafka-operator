[id='assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-bridge-{context}']
= Kafka Bridge cluster configuration

:context: deployment-configuration-kafka-bridge

The full schema of the `KafkaBridge` resource is described in the xref:type-KafkaBridge-reference[].
All labels that are applied to the desired `KafkaBridge` resource will also be applied to the Kubernetes resources making up the Kafka Bridge cluster.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.
