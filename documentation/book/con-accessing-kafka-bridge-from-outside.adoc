= Accessing the {ProductName} Kafka Bridge from outside of Kubernetes

After deployment, the {ProductName} Kafka Bridge can only be accessed by applications running in the same Kubernetes cluster. These applications use the `_kafka-bridge-name_-bridge-service` Service to access the API.

If you want to make the Kafka Bridge accessible to applications running outside of the Kubernetes cluster, you can expose it manually by using one of the following features:

* Kubernetes Services of types LoadBalancer or NodePort

* Kubernetes Ingress resources

* {OpenShiftName} Routes

If you decide to create Services, use the following labels in the `selector` to configure the pods to which the service will route the traffic:

[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
  # ...
  selector:
    strimzi.io/cluster: kafka-bridge-name <1>
    strimzi.io/kind: KafkaBridge
  #...
----
<1> Name of the Kafka Bridge custom resource in your Kubernetes cluster.
