= Getting started with {ProductName}

{ProductName} works on all types of clusters, from public and private clouds to local deployments intended for development.
This guide assumes that a Kubernetes cluster is available and the `kubectl` command-line tool is installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

ifndef::Downloading[]
{ProductName} is based on Strimzi {StrimziVersion}. This chapter describes the procedures to deploy {ProductName} on OpenShift {OpenShiftVersion}.
endif::Downloading[]

ifdef::InstallationAppendix[]
When no existing Kubernetes cluster is available, `minikube` can be used to create a local cluster.
More details can be found in xref:installing_kubernetes_cluster[Installing Kubernetes clusters].
{ProductName} supports a few specific OpenShift-specific features. 
If you need an OpenShift cluster to use these and none is available `minishift` can be used to create a local cluster.
More details can be found in xref:installing_openshift_cluster[Installing OpenShift clusters].
endif::InstallationAppendix[]

NOTE: To run the commands in this guide, your cluster user must have the rights to manage role-based access control (RBAC).

For more information about OpenShift and setting up OpenShift cluster, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/welcome/index.html[OpenShift documentation].
