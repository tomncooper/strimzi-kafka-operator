= Getting started with {ProductName}

{ProductName} works on all types of clusters, from public and private clouds to local deployments intended for development.
This guide assumes that a Kubernetes cluster is available and the
ifdef::Kubernetes[`kubectl`]
ifdef::Kubernetes+OpenShift[ and ]
ifdef::OpenShift[`oc`]
command-line tools are installed and configured to connect to the running cluster.

ifndef::Downloading[]
{ProductName} is based on Strimzi {StrimziVersion}. This chapter describes the procedures to deploy {ProductName} on {OpenShiftName} {OpenShiftVersion}.
endif::Downloading[]

ifdef::InstallationAppendix[]
When no existing {ProductPlatformName} cluster is available,
ifdef::Kubernetes[`Minikube`]
ifdef::Kubernetes+OpenShift[ or ]
ifdef::OpenShift[`Minishift`]
can be used to create a local cluster.
More details can be found in xref:installing_kubernetes_and_openshift_cluster[Installing {ProductPlatformName} clusters].
endif::InstallationAppendix[]

NOTE: To run the commands in this guide, your cluster user must have the rights to manage role-based access control (RBAC).

ifdef::OpenShift[]
For more information about {OpenShiftName} and setting up {OpenShiftName} cluster, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.9/welcome/index.html[OpenShift documentation].
