= Restricting access to Kafka listeners using `networkPolicyPeers`

You can restrict access to a listener to only selected applications by using the `networkPolicyPeers` field.

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster with support for Ingress NetworkPolicies.
* The Cluster Operator is running.

.Procedure

. Open the `Kafka` resource.

. In the `networkPolicyPeers` field, define the application pods or namespaces that will be allowed to access the Kafka cluster.
+
For example, to configure a `tls` listener to allow connections only from application pods with the label `app` set to `kafka-client`:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    listeners:
      tls:
        networkPolicyPeers:
          - podSelector:
              matchLabels:
                app: kafka-client
    # ...
  zookeeper:
    # ...
----

. Create or update the resource.
+
Use `{cmdcli} apply`:
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
{cmdcli} apply -f _your-file_
