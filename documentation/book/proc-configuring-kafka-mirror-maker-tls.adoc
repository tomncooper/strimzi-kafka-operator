= Configuring TLS encryption in Kafka Mirror Maker

.Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster
* A running Cluster Operator
* If they exist, the name of the `Secret` for the certificate used for TLS Server Authentication and the key under which the certificate is stored in the `Secret`

.Procedure

As the Kafka Mirror Maker connects to two Kafka clusters (source and target), you can choose to configure TLS for one or both the clusters.
The following steps describe how to configure TLS on the consumer side for connecting to the source Kafka cluster:

. (Optional) If they do not already exist, prepare the TLS certificate used for authentication in a file and create a `Secret`.
+
NOTE: The secrets created by the Cluster Operator for Kafka cluster may be used directly.
+
This can be done using `{cmdcli} create`:
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
{cmdcli} create secret generic _<my-secret>_ --from-file=_<my-file.crt>_

. Edit the `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.consumer.tls` property.
For example:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaMirrorMaker
metadata:
  name: my-mirror-maker
spec:
  # ...
  consumer:
    tls:
      trustedCertificates:
        - secretName: my-cluster-cluster-cert
          certificate: ca.crt
  # ...
----
+
. Create or update the resource.
+
This can be done using `{cmdcli} apply`:
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
{cmdcli} apply -f _<your-file>_

Repeat the above steps for configuring TLS on the target Kafka cluster.
In this case, the secret containing the certificate has to be configured in the `KafkaMirrorMaker.spec.producer.tls` property.
