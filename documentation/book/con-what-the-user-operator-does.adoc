= Overview of the User Operator component

The User Operator manages Kafka users for a Kafka cluster by watching for `KafkaUser` Kubernetes resources that describe Kafka users and ensuring that they are configured properly in the Kafka cluster.
For example:

* if a `KafkaUser` is created, the User Operator will create the user it describes
* if a `KafkaUser` is deleted, the User Operator will delete the user it describes
* if a `KafkaUser` is changed, the User Operator will update the user it describes

Unlike the xref:what-the-topic-operator-does-str[Topic Operator], the User Operator does not sync any changes from the Kafka cluster with the Kubernetes resources.
Unlike the Kafka topics which might be created by applications directly in Kafka, it is not expected that the users will be managed directly in the Kafka cluster in parallel with the User Operator, so this should not be needed.

The User Operator allows you to declare a `KafkaUser` as part of your application's deployment.
When the user is created, the credentials will be created in a `Secret`.
Your application needs to use the user and its credentials for authentication and to produce or consume messages.

In addition to managing credentials for authentication, the User Operator also manages authorization rules by including a description of the user's rights in the `KafkaUser` declaration.
