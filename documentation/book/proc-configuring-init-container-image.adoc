= Configuring init container image for Kafka rack awareness

When the Kafka rack feature is enabled, Kafka broker pods will use init container which will collect the labels from the {ProductPlatformName} cluster nodes.
The container image which will be used for this container can be configured using the `brokerRackInitImage` property in `Kafka.spec.kafka`.
When the `brokerRackInitImage` field is missing, the following images will be used (in the order of priority):

. Container image specified in `STRIMZI_DEFAULT_KAFKA_INIT_IMAGE` environment variable in Cluster Operator configuration.
. `{DockerKafkaInit}` container image.

WARNING: Overriding container images is recommended only in situations where you need to use a different container registry.
For example, if your network does not allow access to the container repository used by {ProductName}, you should either copy the {ProductName} images or build them from source.
In situations where the configured image is not compatible with {ProductName} images, this might not work properly.

.Prerequisites

* {AProductPlatformName} cluster
* A running Cluster Operator

.Procedure

. Edit the `brokerRackInitImage` property in `Kafka.spec.kafka`.
