= Configuring external clients to trust the cluster CA 

This procedure describes how to configure a Kafka client that resides outside the {ProductPlatformName} cluster – connecting to the `external` listener on port 9094 – to trust the cluster CA certificate.

You can use the same procedure to configure clients inside {ProductPlatformName}, which connect to the `tls` listener on port 9093, but it is usually more convenient to access the `Secrets` using a volume mount in the client `Pod`.

Follow this procedure when setting up the client and during the renewal period, when the old clients CA certificate is replaced.

IMPORTANT: The `_<cluster-name>_-cluster-ca-cert` `Secret` will contain more than one CA certificate during CA certificate renewal. Clients must add _all_ of them to their truststores.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator is running.
* A `Kafka` resource within the {ProductPlatformName} cluster.
* A Kafka client application outside the {ProductPlatformName} cluster which will connect using TLS and needs to trust the cluster CA certificate.

.Procedure

. Extract the cluster CA certificate from the generated `_<cluster-name>_-cluster-ca-cert` `Secret`.
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes"]
kubectl get secret _<cluster-name>_-cluster-ca-cert -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ca.crt

. The Kafka client has to be configured to trust certificates signed by this CA.
For the Java-based Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams APIs, you can do this by importing the CA certificates into the JVM's truststore using the following `keytool` command:
+
[source,shell]
keytool -keystore client.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -import -file ca.crt

. To configure the Kafka client, specify the following properties:

* `security.protocol: SSL` when using TLS for encryption (with or without TLS authentication), or `security.protocol: SASL_SSL` when using SCRAM-SHA authentication over TLS. 
* `ssl.truststore.location`: the truststore location where the certificates were imported.
* `ssl.truststore.password`: the password for accessing the truststore. This property can be omitted if it is not needed by the truststore.
