= {ProductName} custom resource status

The `status` property of a {ProductName}-specific custom resource publishes the _current_ state of the resource to users and tools that need the information.

Status information is useful for tracking progress related to a resource achieving its _desired_ state, as defined by the `spec` property. The `status` provides the time and reason the state of the resource changed and details of events preventing or delaying the Operator from realizing the desired state.

{ProductName} creates and maintains the status of custom resources, periodically evaluating the current state of the custom resource and updating its status accordingly.

When performing an update on a custom resource using `kubectl edit`, for example, its `status` is not editable. Moreover, changing the `status` would not affect the configuration of the Kafka cluster.

IMPORTANT: The status property feature for {ProductName}-specific custom resources is still under development and only available for Kafka resources.

Here we see the `status` property specified for a Kafka custom resource.

<1> Status `conditions` describe criteria related to the status that cannot be deduced from the existing resource information, or are specific to the instance of a resource.
<2> The `Ready` condition indicates whether the Cluster Operator currently considers the Kafka cluster able to handle traffic.
<3> The `listeners` describe the current Kafka bootstrap addresses by type.

IMPORTANT: The status for `external` listeners is still under development and does not provide a specific IP address for external listeners of type `nodeport`.

NOTE: The Kafka bootstrap addresses listed in the status do not signify that those endpoints or the Kafka cluster is in a ready state.

.Accessing status information
You can access status information for a resource from the command line. For more information, see xref:proc-accessing-resource-status-{context}[].
