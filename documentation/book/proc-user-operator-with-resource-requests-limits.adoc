= Configuring the User Operator with resource requests and limits

You can allocate resources, such as CPU and memory, to the User Operator and set a limit on the amount of resources it can consume.

.Prerequisites

* The Cluster Operator is running.

.Procedure

. Update the Kafka cluster configuration in an editor, as required:
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
{cmdcli} edit kafka my-cluster


. In the `spec.entityOperator.userOperator.resources` property in the `Kafka` resource, set the resource requests and limits for the User Operator.
