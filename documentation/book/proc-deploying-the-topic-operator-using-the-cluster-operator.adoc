= Deploying the Topic Operator using the Cluster Operator

This procedure describes how to deploy the Topic Operator using the Cluster Operator. 
If you want to use the Topic Operator with a Kafka cluster that is not managed by {ProductName}, you must deploy the Topic Operator as a standalone component. For more information, see xref:deploying-the-topic-operator-standalone-deploying[].

.Prerequisites

* A running Cluster Operator
* A `Kafka` resource to be created or updated

.Procedure

. Ensure that the `Kafka.spec.entityOperator` object exists in the `Kafka` resource. This configures the Entity Operator.
+
[source,yaml,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  #...
  entityOperator:
    *topicOperator: {}*
    userOperator: {}
----
. Configure the Topic Operator using the fields described in xref:type-EntityTopicOperatorSpec-reference[].
. Create or update the Kafka resource in Kubernetes.
+
Use `kubectl apply`:

kubectl apply -f _your-file_
