= Securing the {ProductName} Kafka Bridge

{ProductName} does not currently provide any encryption, authentication, or authorization for the Kafka Bridge. This means that requests sent from external clients to the Kafka Bridge are:

* Not encrypted, and must use HTTP rather than HTTPS

* Sent without authentication

However, you can secure the Kafka Bridge using other methods, such as:

* Kubernetes Network Policies that define which pods can access the Kafka Bridge.

* Reverse proxies with authentication or authorization, for example, OAuth2 proxies.

* API Gateways.

* Kubernetes Ingress or {OpenShiftName} Routes with TLS termination.

The Kafka Bridge supports TLS encryption and TLS and SASL authentication when connecting to the Kafka Brokers. Within your Kubernetes cluster, you can configure:

* TLS or SASL-based authentication between the Kafka Bridge and your Kafka cluster

* A TLS-encrypted connection between the Kafka Bridge and your Kafka cluster.

For more information, see xref:con-kafka-bridge-authentication-deployment-configuration-kafka-bridge[]. 

You can use ACLs in Kafka brokers to restrict the topics that can be consumed and produced using the Kafka Bridge.
