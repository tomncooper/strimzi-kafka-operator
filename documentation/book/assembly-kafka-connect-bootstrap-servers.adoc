= Bootstrap servers

A Kafka Connect cluster always works in combination with a Kafka cluster.
A Kafka cluster is specified as a list of bootstrap servers.
On Kubernetes, the list must ideally contain the Kafka cluster bootstrap service named `_cluster-name_-kafka-bootstrap`, and a port of 9092 for plain traffic or 9093 for encrypted traffic.

The list of bootstrap servers is configured in the `bootstrapServers` property in `KafkaConnect.spec` and `KafkaConnectS2I.spec`. The servers must be defined as a comma-separated list specifying one or more Kafka brokers, or a service pointing to Kafka brokers specified as a `_hostname_:_port_` pairs.

When using Kafka Connect with a Kafka cluster not managed by {ProductName}, you can specify the bootstrap servers list according to the configuration of the cluster.
