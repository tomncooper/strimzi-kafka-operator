= Authentication support in Kafka Connect

Authentication is configured through the `authentication` property in `KafkaConnect.spec` and `KafkaConnectS2I.spec`.
The `authentication` property specifies the type of the authentication mechanisms which should be used and additional configuration details depending on the mechanism.
The currently supported authentication types are:

* TLS client authentication
* SASL-based authentication using the SCRAM-SHA-512 mechanism
* SASL-based authentication using the PLAIN mechanism

== TLS Client Authentication

To use TLS client authentication, set the `type` property to the value `tls`.
TLS client authentication uses a TLS certificate to authenticate.
The certificate is specified in the `certificateAndKey` property and is always loaded from a Kubernetes secret.
In the secret, the certificate must be stored in X509 format under two different keys: public and private.

NOTE: TLS client authentication can be used only with TLS connections.
For more details about TLS configuration in Kafka Connect see xref:assembly-kafka-connect-tls-{context}[].

== SASL based SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication

To configure Kafka Connect to use SASL-based SCRAM-SHA-512 authentication, set the `type` property to `scram-sha-512`.
This authentication mechanism requires a username and password.

* Specify the username in the `username` property.
* In the `passwordSecret` property, specify a link to a `Secret` containing the password. The `secretName` property contains the name of the `Secret` and the `password` property contains the name of the key under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.

IMPORTANT: Do not specify the actual password in the `password` field.

    passwordSecret:
      secretName: my-connect-user
      password: my-connect-password-key
  # ...
----

== SASL based PLAIN authentication

To configure Kafka Connect to use SASL-based PLAIN authentication, set the `type` property to `plain`.
This authentication mechanism requires a username and password.

WARNING: The SASL PLAIN mechanism will transfer the username and password across the network in cleartext.
Only use SASL PLAIN authentication if TLS encryption is enabled.

* Specify the username in the `username` property.
* In the `passwordSecret` property, specify a link to a `Secret` containing the password. The `secretName` property contains the name of such a `Secret` and the `password` property contains the name of the key under which the password is stored inside the `Secret`.

IMPORTANT: Do not specify the actual password in the `password` field.
