[id='assembly-deployment-configuration-kafka-connect-{context}']
= Kafka Connect cluster configuration

:context: deployment-configuration-kafka-connect

The full schema of the `KafkaConnect` resource is described in the xref:type-KafkaConnect-reference[].
All labels that are applied to the desired `KafkaConnect` resource will also be applied to the Kubernetes resources making up the Kafka Connect cluster.
This provides a convenient mechanism for resources to be labeled as required.
