= JVM configuration

JVM options can be configured using the `jvmOptions` property in following resources:

* `Kafka.spec.kafka`
* `Kafka.spec.zookeeper`
* `KafkaConnect.spec`
* `KafkaConnectS2I.spec`

Only a selected subset of available JVM options can be configured.
The following options are supported:

.-Xms and -Xmx

`-Xms` configures the minimum initial allocation heap size when the JVM starts.
`-Xmx` configures the maximum heap size.

NOTE: The units accepted by JVM settings such as `-Xmx` and `-Xms` are those accepted by the JDK `java` binary in the corresponding image.
Accordingly, `1g` or `1G` means 1,073,741,824 bytes, and `Gi` is not a valid unit suffix.
This is in contrast to the units used for xref:assembly-resource-limits-and-requests-{context}[memory requests and limits], which follow the Kubernetes convention where `1G` means 1,000,000,000 bytes, and `1Gi` means 1,073,741,824 bytes

The default values used for `-Xms` and `-Xmx` depends on whether there is a xref:assembly-resource-limits-and-requests-{context}[memory request] limit configured for the container:

* If there is a memory limit then the JVM's minimum and maximum memory will be set to a value corresponding to the limit.
* If there is no memory limit then the JVM's minimum memory will be set to `128M` and the JVM's maximum memory will not be defined.  This allows for the JVM's memory to grow as-needed, which is ideal for single node environments in test and development.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Setting `-Xmx` explicitly requires some care:

* The JVM's overall memory usage will be approximately 4 × the maximum heap, as configured by `-Xmx`.
* If `-Xmx` is set without also setting an appropriate Kubernetes memory limit, it is possible that the container will be killed should the Kubernetes node experience memory pressure (from other Pods running on it).
* If `-Xmx` is set without also setting an appropriate Kubernetes memory request, it is possible that the container will be scheduled to a node with insufficient memory.
In this case, the container will not start but crash (immediately if `-Xms` is set to `-Xmx`, or some later time if not).
====

When setting `-Xmx` explicitly, it is recommended to:

* set the memory request and the memory limit to the same value,
* use a memory request that is at least 4.5 × the `-Xmx`,
* consider setting `-Xms` to the same value as `-Xms`.

IMPORTANT: Containers doing lots of disk I/O (such as Kafka broker containers) will need to leave some memory available for use as operating system page cache.
On such containers, the requested memory should be significantly higher than the memory used by the JVM.

.Example fragment configuring `-Xmx` and `-Xms`
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
jvmOptions:
  "-Xmx": "2g"
  "-Xms": "2g"
# ...
----

In the above example, the JVM will use 2 GiB (=2,147,483,648 bytes) for its heap.
Its total memory usage will be approximately 8GiB.

Setting the same value for initial (`-Xms`) and maximum (`-Xmx`) heap sizes avoids the JVM having to allocate memory after startup, at the cost of possibly allocating more heap than is really needed.
For Kafka and Zookeeper pods such allocation could cause unwanted latency.
For Kafka Connect avoiding over allocation may be the most important concern, especially in distributed mode where the effects of over-allocation will be multiplied by the number of consumers.

.-server

`-server` enables the server JVM. This option can be set to true or false.

.Example fragment configuring `-server`
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
jvmOptions:
  "-server": true
# ...
----

NOTE: When neither of the two options (`-server` and `-XX`) is specified, the default Apache Kafka configuration of `KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS` will be used.

.-XX

`-XX` object can be used for configuring advanced runtime options of a JVM.
The `-server` and `-XX` options are used to configure the `KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS` option of Apache Kafka.

.Example showing the use of the `-XX` object
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
jvmOptions:
  "-XX":
    "UseG1GC": true,
    "MaxGCPauseMillis": 20,
    "InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent": 35,
    "ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent": true,
    "UseParNewGC": false
----

The example configuration above will result in the following JVM options:

[source]
----
-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=20 -XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=35 -XX:+ExplicitGCInvokesConcurrent -XX:-UseParNewGC
----

NOTE: When neither of the two options (`-server` and `-XX`) is specified, the default Apache Kafka configuration of `KAFKA_JVM_PERFORMANCE_OPTS` will be used.

== Garbage collector logging

The `jvmOptions` section also allows you to enable and disable garbage collector (GC) logging.
GC logging is enabled by default.
To disable it, set the `gcLoggingEnabled` property as follows:

.Example of disabling GC logging
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
# ...
jvmOptions:
  gcLoggingEnabled: false
# ...
