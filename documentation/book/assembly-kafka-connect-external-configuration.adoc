= Using external configuration and secrets

Kafka Connect connectors are configured using an HTTP REST interface.
The connector configuration is passed to Kafka Connect as part of an HTTP request and stored within Kafka itself.

Some parts of the configuration of a Kafka Connect connector can be externalized using ConfigMaps or Secrets.
You can then reference the configuration values in HTTP REST commands (this keeps the configuration separate and more secure, if needed).
This method applies especially to confidential data, such as usernames, passwords, or certificates.

ConfigMaps and Secrets are standard Kubernetes resources used for storing of configurations and confidential data.
