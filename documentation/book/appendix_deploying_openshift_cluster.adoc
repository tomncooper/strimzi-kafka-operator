== Installing an OpenShift cluster

The easiest way to get started with OpenShift is using `Minishift` or `oc cluster up`.

This section provides basic guidance on how to use them.

For more information on the tools, refer to the documentation available online.

In order to interact with an OpenShift cluster, the https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[`oc`] utility is needed.

An OpenShift cluster can be started in two different ways. The `oc` utility can start a cluster locally using the
command:

[source,shell]
oc cluster up

This command requires Docker to be installed. More information about this way can be found
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/docs/cluster_up_down.md[here].

Another option is to use `Minishift`. `Minishift` is an OpenShift installation within a VM. It can be downloaded and
installed from the https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/index.html[Minishift website]. Depending on the number of brokers
you want to deploy inside the cluster and if you need Kafka Connect running as well, it could be worth running `Minishift`
at least with 4 GB of RAM instead of the default 2 GB.
Once installed, `Minishift` can be started using the following command:

[source,shell]
minishift start --memory 4GB
