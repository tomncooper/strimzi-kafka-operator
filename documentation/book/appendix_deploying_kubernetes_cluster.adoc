== Installing a Kubernetes cluster

The easiest way to get started with Kubernetes is using `Minikube`.
This section provides basic guidance on how to use it.
For more information on the tools, refer to the documentation available online.

In order to interact with a Kubernetes cluster the https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[`kubectl`]
utility needs to be installed.

The easiest way to get a running Kubernetes cluster is using `Minikube`.
`Minikube` can be downloaded and installed from the https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/[Kubernetes website]. 
Depending on the number of brokers you want to deploy inside the cluster and if you need Kafka Connect running as well, it could be worth running `Minikube` at least with 4 GB of RAM instead of the default 2 GB.
Once installed, it can be started using:

[source,shell]
minikube start --memory 4096
