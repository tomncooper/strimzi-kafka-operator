= Extending Kafka Connect with connector plug-ins

The {ProductName} container images for Kafka Connect include the two built-in file connectors: `FileStreamSourceConnector` and `FileStreamSinkConnector`.
You can add your own connectors by:

* Creating a Docker image from the Kafka Connect base image.
* On OpenShift, creating a container image using OpenShift builds and Source-to-Image (S2I).
