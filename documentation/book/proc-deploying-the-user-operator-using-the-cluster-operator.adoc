= Deploying the User Operator using the Cluster Operator

.Prerequisites

* A running Cluster Operator
* A `Kafka` resource to be created or updated.

.Procedure

. Create or update the Kafka resource in {ProductPlatformName}.
+
This can be done using `kubectl apply`:
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
kubectl apply -f _your-file_
