Kafka Connect clusters can run multiple of nodes.
The number of nodes is defined in the `KafkaConnect` and `KafkaConnectS2I` resources.
Running a Kafka Connect cluster with multiple nodes can provide better availability and scalability.
However, when running Kafka Connect on Kubernetes it is not absolutely necessary to run multiple nodes of Kafka Connect for high availability.
If a node where Kafka Connect is deployed to crashes, Kubernetes will automatically reschedule the Kafka Connect pod to a different node.
However, running Kafka Connect with multiple nodes can provide faster failover times, because the other nodes will be up and running already.
