IMPORTANT: When two application are scheduled to the same Kubernetes node, both applications might use the same resources like disk I/O and impact performance.
That can lead to performance degradation.
Scheduling Kafka pods in a way that avoids sharing nodes with other critical workloads, using the right nodes or dedicated a set of nodes only for Kafka are the best ways how to avoid such problems.
