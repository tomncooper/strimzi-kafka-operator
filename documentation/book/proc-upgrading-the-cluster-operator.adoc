= Upgrading the Cluster Operator to a later version

This procedure describes how to upgrade a Cluster Operator deployment to a later version.

.Prerequisites

* An existing Cluster Operator deployment.

.Procedure

. Backup the existing Cluster Operator resources:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{cmdcli} get all -l app=strimzi -o yaml > strimzi-backup.yaml
----

. Update the Cluster Operator.
+
Modify the installation files according to the {PlatformNameNamespace} the Cluster Operator is running in.
+
include::frag-cluster-operator-namespace-sed.adoc[]
+
If you modified one or more environment variables in your existing Cluster Operator `Deployment`, edit the
`install/cluster-operator/050-Deployment-cluster-operator.yaml` file to reflect the changes that you made in the new version of the Cluster Operator.

. When you have an updated configuration, deploy it along with the rest of the install resources:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{cmdcli} apply -f install/cluster-operator
----
+
Wait for the rolling updates to complete.

. Get the image for the Kafka pod to ensure the upgrade was successful:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
{cmdcli} get po my-cluster-kafka-0 -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].image}'
----
+
The image tag shows the new {ProductName} version followed by the Kafka version. For example, `_<New {ProductName} version>_-kafka-_<Current Kafka version>_`.

. Update existing resources to handle deprecated custom resource properties.
+
* xref:assembly-upgrade-resources-{context}[{ProductName} resource upgrades]

You now have an updated Cluster Operator, but the version of Kafka running in the cluster it manages is unchanged.

.What to do next

Following the Cluster Operator upgrade, you can perform a xref:assembly-upgrading-kafka-versions-str[Kafka upgrade].
