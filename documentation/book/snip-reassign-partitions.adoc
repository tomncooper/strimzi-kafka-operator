. Copy the `_reassignment.json_` file to the broker pod on which you will later execute the commands:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cat _reassignment.json_ | \
  {cmdcli} exec _broker-pod_ -c kafka -i -- /bin/bash -c \
  'cat > /tmp/reassignment.json'
----
+
For example:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
cat _reassignment.json_ | \
  {cmdcli} exec my-cluster-kafka-0 -c kafka -i -- /bin/bash -c \
  'cat > /tmp/reassignment.json'
----

. Execute the partition reassignment using the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` command line tool from the same broker pod.
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
{cmdcli} exec _broker-pod_ -c kafka -it -- \
  bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 \
  --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
  --execute
----
+
If you are going to throttle replication you can also pass the `--throttle` option with an inter-broker throttled rate in bytes per second. For example:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
{cmdcli} exec my-cluster-kafka-0 -c kafka -it -- \
  bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 \
  --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
  --throttle 5000000 \
  --execute
----
+
This command will print out two reassignment JSON objects. 
The first records the current assignment for the partitions being moved. 
You should save this to a local file (not a file in the pod) in case you need to revert the reassignment later on. 
The second JSON object is the target reassignment you have passed in your reassignment JSON file.

. If you need to change the throttle during reassignment you can use the same command line with a different throttled rate. For example:
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
{cmdcli} exec my-cluster-kafka-0 -c kafka -it -- \
  bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 \
  --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
  --throttle 10000000 \
  --execute
----

. Periodically verify whether the reassignment has completed using the `kafka-reassign-partitions.sh` command line tool from any of the broker pods. This is the same command as the previous step but with the `--verify` option instead of the `--execute` option.
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
{cmdcli} exec _broker-pod_ -c kafka -it -- \
  bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 \
  --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
  --verify
----
+
For example,
+
[source,shell,subs="+quotes,attributes+"]
----
{cmdcli} exec my-cluster-kafka-0 -c kafka -it -- \
  bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 \
  --reassignment-json-file /tmp/reassignment.json \
  --verify
----

. The reassignment has finished when the `--verify` command reports each of  the partitions being moved as completed successfully. 
This final `--verify` will also have the effect of removing any reassignment throttles.
You can now delete the revert file if you saved the JSON for reverting the assignment to their original brokers.
